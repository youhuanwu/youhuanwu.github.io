title:  "RPA Social Insurance Automation"
---

## Purpose

In a human resources outsourcing company with numerous projects and high employee turnover, social insurance enrollment and cancellation processes were performed frequently.

Automated repetitive web operations and data submission on third-party sites.

## Key Features

Monitor emails, read specific email Excel attachments, and open the official website to process social insurance contributions or cancellations.

## Challenges

The official page updates frequently, and the submission logic may change. Some date controls use a click-to-popup selection style, making automation more challenging.

## Implementation

The main framework uses visual low-code automation software, combined with Python automation libraries. Web operation parts require JavaScript.
